# Reliable Re-detection for long-term tracking
Code for the method described in the paper **Reliable Re-detection for long-term tracking**

Our framework is based on the algorithm Staple. More detials will be introduced latter. 

###Prerequisites
 - The code is mostly in MATLAB, except the workhorse of `fhog.m`, which is written in C and comes from Piotr Dollar toolbox http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox
 - gradientMex and mexResize have been compiled and tested for Ubuntu and Windows 7 (64 bit). You can easily recompile the sources in case of need.
